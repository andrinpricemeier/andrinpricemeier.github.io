# Quick start: How to get a working blog in 10 seconds

It seems like the easiest way (I mean much easier than dealing with Jekyll or Eleventy or so).
Is to simply add a _layouts folder, a _posts folder and then create a github.io repository on GitHub
will do the rest. Feel free to clone this repository and you will be up and running with a new blog
in 10 seconds (instead of hours, dealing with build errors).
