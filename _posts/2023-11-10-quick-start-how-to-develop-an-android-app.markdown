# Quick start: How to develop an android app

Quickly summarized: Developing an Android application if you are not a full time Java Software Engineer is next
to impossible.

But! There is a simpler way. Check out the application I made: https://github.com/andrinpricemeier/brauch-ich-ein-ga.

It's fairly simple to develop an Android application these days actually if you know a little bit of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Just use the following technologies:

* React Native
* JavaScript/TypeScript/whatever
* Some kind of UI framework such as TailwindCSS

And then deploy everything with a service called Expo which takes care of managing keys and everything for you.
All you have to do is register your app on the app store and test it locally too, of course.

Have fun!
