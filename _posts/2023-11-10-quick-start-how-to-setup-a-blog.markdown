# Quick start: How to get a working blog in 10 seconds

It seems like the easiest way (I mean much easier than dealing with Jekyll or Eleventy or so),
is to simply add a _layouts folder (and add a home.html file) and a _posts folder (where you'll add your posts named after a certain pattern)
and then create a github.io repository on GitHub.

Check out this blog's source code for an example: https://github.com/andrinpricemeier/andrinpricemeier.github.io
