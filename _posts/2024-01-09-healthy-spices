# Healthy Spices

Disclaimer: I am not a doctor. If you have health problems, you should consult your doctor.

According to my research, the following spices help the most:

* Curcumin/Termuric
* Cinnamon
* Cooked tomatos (yes, it's not a spice, but very important)
* Ginger
* Chia seeds

Eat these every day whenever you can and your body will thank you.
