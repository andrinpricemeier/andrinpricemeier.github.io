# Modern Medicine: Medicaments

Disclaimer: I am not a doctor. If you have health problems, you should consult your doctor.

Many have an outdated view of what medicaments actually work or how far medicine has actually progressed. Let me quickly summarize my latest research findings:

* Red laser: Actually helps if you've had traumatic experiences or brain damages. It causes neurons to be grow and proliferate.
* Fluoride: Helps with cavities. The bacteria caused by cavities can actually cause cognitive impairment.
* Flossing: This is even more important than brushing your teeth. See above.
* Hydroxyzine: Cream that helps with itchy skin. Available everywhere.
* Laughing: Activates natural killer cells. Repairs your body.
* Sorbitol: Helps if you can't "shit" properly. It is available in menthol chewing gums, fishermen's friends.
* Metformin/Glucophage: Helps with diabetes
* Ibuprofen: Helps with teeth problems, menstrual cramps, arthritis, fever
* Finasteride: Hair loss and prostatha problems
* Minoxidil/Lonoxol: Heart problems or hair problems
* Vaseline: Everything
* Livsane: Ice spray, if you have fallen and need to quickly treat it
* Celluvisc: Eye gel
* Differin: Induces collagen. Repairs cells. Cellulite can actually be treated with this.
