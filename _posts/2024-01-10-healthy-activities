# Healthy activities

Disclaimer: I am not a doctor. If you have health problems, you should consult your doctor.

Here are a few things that can help you live a healthier life. According to latest research:

* Low calorie diet: Everything gets converted into glucose. Sugar is the worst. Glucose damages your body in every way imaginable. The only way to deal with this is to eat less.
* Strength training: Makes your hippocampus bigger, helps with bone growth, helps with fatigue and much more.
* Intense Cardio: Produces nitric oxide which helps with cognitive impairment and basically everything else in your body.
* Sleep: Sleep detoxifies your brain. Very important.
* Acupunctur
* Yoga: For stress and body ailments
* Meditation: Nitric Oxide. Again.
* Chi Gong: Helps your vagus nerve (look it up). Stress reliever.
* Sauna: Nitric Oxide. Again. Purifies body.
