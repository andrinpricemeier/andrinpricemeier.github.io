# Healthy Drinks

Disclaimer: I am not a doctor. If you have health problems, you should consult your doctor.

The best thing to drink is Oolong tea each day. It has caffeeine, but a less damaging one than Green Tea and Coffee and it has lots of polyphenols, antioxidants.
Do not drink tea with milk though, since the casein in milk is not good for the healthy benefits.

Other drinks:
* Green tea: Similar to Oolong
* Coffee: Helps with Alzheimers and Cancer (no milk or sugar though)
* Cocoa: Flavonoid rich, 70+ dark chocolate. It is bitter, yes. Just put it in your coffee and be done with it.
* Alcohol: Is actually not THAT bad in moderation. Especially "Gl√ºhwein" or red wine. It contains reservatrol. Reservatrol is important for the sirtuin protein which helps immensely with anti-aging!
