# How to learn anything

Disclaimer: I am not a doctor. If you have health problems, you should consult your doctor.

According to my latest research, this is what actually helps you learn. Remember: Anyone is smart enough to learn anything. If something is too difficult for you, you lack the knowledge requirements or you need to break down the concept into smaller ones.

* Dual-N-Back: Helps with the working memory.
* Spaced Repetition: Use Anki. It is a flashcard based app. Whenever you see something, create a card with a question. That helps you activate your brain cells more and helps you learn. You will never forget anything anymore.
* TCDS: Flow Science is a good company for this. It stimulates your brain and actually makes you think better. Repairs neurons.
* Exercise: Yes. Exercise. It activates "a good gene" that actually grows your Hippocampus! The hippocampus is the part of your brain that manages your memories.
