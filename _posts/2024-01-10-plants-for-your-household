# Plants for your household

Disclaimer: I am not a doctor. If you have health problems, you should consult your doctor.

Plants are very important in your household. Just make sure they don't grow fungi.

Best plants according to NASA and other sources:

* Philodendrons
* Spider plants
* Golden Pothos

If you don't like plants, just get a HEPA-Filter.
