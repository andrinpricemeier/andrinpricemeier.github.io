# The 3 big diseases

Disclaimer: I am not a doctor. If you have health problems, you should consult your doctor.

Mankind is currently plagued by the following big three diseases: Alzheimers, Diabetes and Cancer. Without those, humans could live forever. I will quickly summarize my latest findings on these diseases.

## Alzheimer

Mainly caused by beta-amyloids but also neurofibrially tangles. The Apo E gene actually removes those beta amyloid plaques. What helps with Alzheimers in general is doing exercise and always learning new things.
A leading cause of Alzheimers is aluminium. There is medicine such as Benadryl that can cause Alzheimers.

## Diabetes

Diabetes can actually be managed without any medicine. Lots of exercise, low calories diet, no stress and low blood pressure.

## Cancer

See the list of supplements post. Cancer can be prevented in many cancers in different ways. Chemotherapy is actually even worse than cancer.
